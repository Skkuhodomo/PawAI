# PawAI 🐕 🐾

**PawAI (ResNet50)**: Designed to identify your pet's breed, this model is recommended for cases where you are unsure about your pet's breed.


**GPT-Vision (Prompt-Tuning)**: The GPT-Vision module has been fine-tuned with prompt-tuning capabilities. By uploading your pet's image, GPT will analyze both your pet's overall condition and accurately determine its breed.
