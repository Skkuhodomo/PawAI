**PawAI (ResNet50)**: Designed to identify your pet's breed, this model is recommended for cases where you are unsure about your pet's breed.


**GPT-Vision (Prompt-Tuning)**: The GPT-Vision module has been fine-tuned with prompt-tuning capabilities. By uploading your pet's image, GPT will analyze both your pet's overall condition and accurately determine its breed.

**"Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?"**


ResNet was prompted by a pivotal question: does incorporating more layers consistently lead to superior models? PainNet's primary aim was to minimize H(x). However, this proves to be challenging when the value of x is not fixed and can be altered in models. Researchers posit that addressing this challenge becomes feasible when x is intricately linked to the output, expressed as F(x) + x. Consequently, in this context, H(x) is represented as F(x) + x. To minimize H(x), the emphasis shifts to ensuring that F(x) = -x. This underlying concept forms the essence of ResNet. Despite the dynamic nature of x in both models, ResNet redefines the role of F(x) to align with x. This shift in focus significantly enhances accuracy.

## GPT-VISION
With **Langchainü¶ú‚õìÔ∏è** you can load openAI model. 

I modified a GPT prompt so that it can be a **veterinarian** who can identify the breed and condition of pets through images.
